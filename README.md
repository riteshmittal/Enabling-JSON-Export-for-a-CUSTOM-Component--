Enabling JSON Export for a CUSTOM Component- 
GET JSON RESPONSE FROM EXPERIENCE FRAGEMENT, SITE PAGE

Components can be adapted to generate JSON export of their content based on a modeler framework.
This is useful in case we have custom component inside a container for which we want to pull data in JSON format.
For example if we have created experience fragment/ site page and have configured components inside it and now want to pull all XF/site page as JSON instead of HTML.
Core components provides export in json format out of the box but for custom components we need to enable it via few annotations, explained in this video.
